It snows heavily today but we have to go to CS400 lecture. I needed to walk from
 humanities to Biochemistry building. I felt like I was in the South Pole right

 everyone's head turned into weird shapes and their skin turned into green.
 I was really scared, and then I found out that nobody could see me. I said hi
 to my classmates and they just ignore me. It was so wierd and I figured out
 two possibilities of this situation: one is that I traveled from another world for
 some reason to this ghost city and the other is that I am the ghost. When I opened
 my laptop to submit the p2 project assignment, I found nothing in my laptop-it
 was just blank. And then....
